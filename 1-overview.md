Parking Finder's purpose is to help people who struggle finding a parking spot, find one.

The reason why I wanted to make this app is because this comes from a real-world experience that I’ve seen first-hand.

The user can use the maps to scroll in and out to wherever they want to park and see if any is available. The app uses the device’s current location and discovers the nearest parking spots, and it allows the user to scroll in and see it up close so they can figure out if that’s the parking spot they want. The parking spot will be noticeable by a green marker so they can see the parking spot when they have zoomed out. This saves the user so much time driving around trying to find a parking spot and it can help their anxiety when it comes to finding a parking spot. They can also add their favourite addresses that also saves them time instead of searching it up everytime. The added favourite address can be deleted or clicked which will redirect you to the map.

When the user opens the app, they will be confronted with a map where they can see their current location and a search bar so they can input where they would like to find parking spaces.
