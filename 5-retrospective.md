# Retrospective

Student ID: `21063494`

I was initially worried about starting on the app development path due to my perceived lack of preparedness. However, through extensive research and dedicated efforts, I was able to gain more confidence and exceed my initial expectations by incorporating a wide array of advanced features into the app.

Several obstacles arose during the development process that required me to do some research. Notably, when I refactored the main activity code into distinct classes to improve code management. However, the buttons stopped working properly. When trying to resolve this issue, it was revealed that the button in the main activity was not properly linked to the matching method in another class, this is because when changing the text button to an image button, I forgot to input the method name. By repairing this link, I was able to effectively restore the desired button functionality.

Additionally, I faced the challenge of the maps loading times, which hampered the app's performance. To overcome this obstacle, I strategically implemented configuration settings within the Osmdroid library. Specifically, I adjusted the maximum cache size for the tile file system cache, resulting in improved map loading speed and enhanced overall app performance.

If I had more time, I would prioritise the development of a feature that offers users with detailed directions from their current location to the allotted parking spot. Furthermore, I would like to incorporate a real-time traffic monitoring capability to allow users to make informed decisions about optimal route choices.

In future versions, I would consider using Google Maps as an alternative mapping method. Its visually appealing interface and improved legibility during navigation have the potential to dramatically improve user experience and overall app aesthetics.
