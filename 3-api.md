The choice of APIs when developing the application was inspired by the app's requirements, as well as the need to balance functionality, simplicity, and effciency.
The APIs used are appropiate for the app's features, ensuring that it is not under engineered. 

The Google Places API was chosen due to its databases of places and its powerful search capabilities. By using this API, the app can provide users with accurate and up-to-date information about various locations, making it suitable for tasks such as new roads, businesses, etc.

I decided to chose the Google Play Services Location API over the native Android Location API because it offers better accuracy. This API enables real-time location tracking and geofencing capabilities, which are essential for location based services making it a more reliable and seamless experience to its users.
